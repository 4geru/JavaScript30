## About

Build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript; no frameworks, libraries, etc. 
  Pacing is totally up to the individual; if you feel like knocking out 30 challenges
  in 30 minutes, hey, more power to you, but that would miss the point of this course (IMO).
  The idea behind these exercises is to utilize small amounts of what would regularly be
  'downtime' as moments in which we can build on our knowledge through some simple
  exercises. My goal is to _participate_ in 3 challenges per day (watch the videos, take 
  some notes, etc.) and to _complete_ one challenge per day.

The starter files (available [here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)) include solutions to 
  most challenges, so this isn't really meant to be taken as some kind of competition or something. 
  JavaScript30 appears to be focused more on helping developers enhance their current skillset and 
  reducing developer reliance on external JS libraries; **if it can be done with a JS library, 
  it can (probably) be done with vanilla JS.**

**UPDATE:** If you're here for written guides, please be patient with me! I've made it a priority
to get as many of these done as possible, as quickly as possible. Thank youuu. ❤️

Completed written guides can be found in the corresponding challenge directory (click the links below, folks).
