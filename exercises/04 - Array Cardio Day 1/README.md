Not really much of a guide necessary for this one. The challenge is pretty
well documented as far as what's expected from the developer; use
built-in array methods and perform the necessary operations to provide
the expected values. Easy peasy.

If you're unfamiliar with JavaScript array methods, Mozilla docs are your
friend.

Woooooooo all done with day 4!
